# Online-Learning-Platform

This is the design and implementation of a SQL database made to cater to needs of an online learning platform

## Why This?

Even before the covid-19 pandemic , online forums were on the rise. More and more people were using the internet for all sorts of things. Education was no different.
Covid only accelarated this and we all know how much we depend on such online learnig platforms and communities.

So we (Me and my partner Naman) tried to make a database structure that could serve as the backbone of such a database.
More on this in the problem-statement and report pdf.

## Design

We looked into quite a few existing platforms (like Udemy and Coursera) to try and figure out the kind of partitioning they have done of data, and what our design 
should fulfill. We tried to figure out the schemas used and the relation between these.

Below is the Entity Relationship Diagram we came up with : 

Below is the relation schema :

Platform used for creating above diagrams is [ERD PLUS](https://erdplus.com/)

## Technologies Used
We used [Oracle Sql Developer](https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/) for making the tables and running queries on them.
More about the queries and their implemenation in the sql file.
